So for example, if you want to keep anything you wanted, you can do it with us, you just gotta let us know the size of the object, and the warehouse you're gonna put it in. The payment method works in a way so that it takes the amount of time you left the good in there, and also it depends on it's volume, size, weight and value..</p>
